# MyCppLib

This project was started recently and is still far from complete.

This is a custom cpp library to improve my workflow on personal and professional projects.
Namespace and using keyword have been omitted to facilitate integration to projects.

- A more convenient way of printing than std::cout
- More utility functions for your workflow

## Features / How to use

### printer.hpp

  Usage: import printer.hpp and call out(), pass variables and objects as parameters to the out function.
  out() takes an arbitrary amount of arguments that can be all scalar types and most containers, some of the less common containers have not been included, out() prints a new line after every parameter;
  
### Checker.hpp

  TypeChecker::isContainer(), will check if the parameter given is a container or not, returning true or false.
