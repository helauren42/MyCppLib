# Overview

This project was started recently and is still far from complete.

This is a custom cpp library to improve my workflow on personal and professional projects.
Namespace and using keyword have been omitted to facilitate integration to projects.

Here are the different sections of the library
- Printer.hpp: A more convenient way of printing than using cout as containers can be passed directly as argument
- Strings.hpp: String manipulation library

### Printer/Printer.hpp

  Usage: import Printer.hpp into your project and call out(), pass variables and objects as parameters to the out function.
  out() takes an arbitrary amount of arguments that can be scalar types or containers, some of the less common containers have not been included, out() prints a new line after every parameter, except for c strings.
  
### Strings/Strings.hpp
